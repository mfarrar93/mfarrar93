   Activity 1<br>
 The first activity was a nice overview of internet safety and best practices. I liked the analogy of the first reading where it says to treat the internet like a shopping mall. You wouldn’t give out your credit card number to anyone there and you’d make sure to lock your car. Similarly, there are basic safety steps to take when using the internet. There were some common-sense tips such as creating a strong password no one can guess and only shopping at sites you know and trust. I liked other tips such as understanding your browser’s security features. Some browsers will have built in pp-up and ad blocking while others will require extensions for those functions. Identifying spam and phishing emails is another important lesson. Everyone will be subject to spam and phishing at some point and there are good tips for identifying and avoiding it.

 The next activity involved learning about anti-malware programs. There are multiple free resources to scan and monitor your computer for malware and it is a valuable lesson for all computer users to understand this. In recent years I have been satisfied with the Windows Defender application that has been built into the last few versions of Windows. Before that I used Malwarebytes which is the program I decided to use for the activity. It was straightforward and easy to use. I ran a quick scan and found no issues but I was happy with the ease of use and may recommend this to friends and family who experience malware issues.
