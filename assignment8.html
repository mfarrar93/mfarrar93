  <h1>Assignment 8</h1>

    Activity 1<br>
    The first activity was an excellent overview of internet safety and best practices. I liked the analogy of the first
    reading where it says to treat the internet like a shopping mall. You wouldn’t give out your credit card number to
    anyone there and would make sure to lock your car. Similarly, there are basic safety steps to take when using the
    internet. There were some common-sense tips such as creating a strong password no one can guess and only shopping at
    sites you know and trust. I liked other tips such as understanding your browser’s security features. Some browsers
    will have built-in pop-ups and ad blocking while others will require extensions for those functions. Identifying
    spam and phishing emails is another important lesson. Everyone will be subject to spam and phishing at some point
    and there are good tips for identifying and avoiding it.

    Activity 3<br>
    The next activity involved learning about anti-malware programs. There are multiple free resources to scan and
    monitor your computer for malware and it is a valuable lesson for all computer users to understand. In recent years
    I have been satisfied with the Windows Defender application that has been built into the last few versions of
    Windows. Before that, I used Malwarebytes which is the program I decided to use for the activity. It was
    straightforward to use. I ran a quick scan and found no issues but I was happy with the ease of use and may
    recommend this to friends and family who experience malware issues.

    Activity 4 <br>
    This was an interesting topic for me because while I have previously used multi-factor authentication, I had not
    used password managers before. For multi-factor authentication, I have used a variety of services such as Google and
    Steam which will do two-step authentication by sending you a text message code. I have also used the Google
    authenticator app. In the past, I have been uncomfortable using a password manager because I did not like the idea
    of giving one application or service all of my login information. I can see from what I learned in the lesson that
    there are useful and secure options that will help safeguard my privacy online. I looked through the options
    presented and I think I will pick a free one to use shortly. I definitely need to update my passwords and use a
    larger variety of passwords across the services I use online.
