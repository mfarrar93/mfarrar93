Assignment 1

I have already completed several CIS classes that cover the internet and how it works in a more detailed way than I anticipate this course will. For example, I am already familiar with the information presented in the first activity and a significant amount more. Those classes covered basics like IP addresses and basic function of the internet but also went into detail including extensively covering the 7 layer OSI internet model and the function of each layer. I am also very familiar with internet threats such as malicious programs, data theft, security problems, and more. The models of how you connect to the internet were also familiar from previous courses I have taken. I'm a returning student who didn't grow up with tablets or touchscreens so I am very familiar with using computers and a variety of operating systems, programs, and hardware. I have assembled half a dozen computers over the last 15 years and upgraded them countless times. I have familiarity with Windows, Linux, and OS X (macOS). I have also used all three of those operating systems in virtual machines and terminal clients. I am very familiar with a lot of the other information covered such as wiring networks, setting up wireless networks, typing, and manipulating/saving/sharing files, folders, documents, etc. I have some coding experience but I was largely self-taught and the basics of a few languages, with the most knowledge in Java. I was able to create websites and knew CSS and HTML but am unfamiliar with new features including HTML 5.

I had never previously used GitHub and the information on that was helpful. I had heard of the site and used it to download programs many times but have never had a personal page. I was unaware of the wide variety of things you can do with a GitHub account and it all seemed fairly straightforward.

I think a lot of my prior knowledge should be a benefit in this course and the context it provides will help me to learn more in this course and better understand the courses I have already taken.

Activity 2:
I knew the information presented here fairly well.
  I am familiar with various applications on different operating systems.
  This activity remided me of some basic fundamentals and how important they are to understand newer concepts
  I also knew the keyboard and mouse shortcuts that were taught in these tutorials as well.  
  Since I knew keyboard shortcuts already I do not think about how important it is to know them but I realize that they are hugely beneficial to new computer users.
  The one new piece of information I was happy to learn was using the alt key to access menus in an application.

Activity 3:
I am also completely familiar with the concepts presented here.
  These concepts are very important though because I have seen many computers where people have trouble finding files and information.
   They often have all of their files in a single folder or sitting on the desktop of their computer making organization impossible.
  I know how to organize a file system, transfer files, image drives, and save and backup data. This is a good overview but not necessarily new information.

Activity 4:
I found this information useful but again not new to me. 
 I am experienced in creating files and folders on the three major operating systems as well as through a command line.
    Again I understand the necessity of this information as a base to build upon.
    I have dealt with friends and family who have trouble saving and backing up data and have often had to explain and implement things like USB drive backups and cloud storage for them.
  The one new thing I liked was learning that holding the alt key while dragging something to the desktop creates a shortcut.
    It goes to show even someone who thinks they know about a subject always has more to learn
