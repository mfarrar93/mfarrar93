    <p>This was a very interesting assignment as I was unfamiliar with Javascript, especially in comparison with HTML
        and CSS. I did not know how simple it was to create graphics and even interactive elements on an HTML web page.
        I believe the canvas feature we used is new to HTML 5 and that may explain why when I looked at JavaScipt in the
        past it seemed a bit more intimidating. While using JavaScript was more complex and closer to actual coding than
        writing HTML, I still found it fairly straightforward and readable. I think the main challenge will be
        remembering many new functions and integrating JavaScript with my knowledge of HTML and CSS</p>
