  <h1>Assignment 6</h1>

  <p>
    Activity 1<br>
    I thought this was a very useful activity because I have recently made a career change and the reading made me feel
    much more justified in that decision. I spent over 10 years in retail and 4 as a department manager and eventually
    realized I needed to make a change for many of the reasons listed in the activity. Though I was successful I was
    unhappy as the culture and values in that industry did not align with me. I decided that while I had opportunity for
    career advancement, I wanted a different type of career. This was mainly due to issues of work life balance. I am
    currently gaining job skills in my classes and have made an education plan with my counselor to have a degree by
    this time next year. I think another important point brought up was salary requirements. While a lot of money can be
    nice I have realized that making enough to be comfortable while having a job that provides a good work/life balance
    is more important than just pay.

    Activity 2<br>
    I have found resources like this extremely useful, especially when I was deciding to transition into a new career.
    IT is an ever-expanding industry with ample opportunities. I have noticed the issue they mentioned where companies
    are hiring for entry-level jobs but requiring experience for it. I have completed the CompTIA+ class as well as
    other certification-related classes and I think that will go a long way to getting my foot in the door at a job. It
    was reassuring to read that many companies are interested in the certifications I have already earned or am
    currently working on.

    Activity 3 <br>
    I found this activity very relevant as I am currently looking for work. I had trouble writing a resume and needed
    the help of a family friend who works as a headhunter to get my resume into shape. I think the resources provided in
    this tutorial largely mirror her advice and help to develop a solid resume. I thought the concept of not only
    defining your skills but explaining them and relating how they are relevant to the job you are applying for was
    especially important. Tailoring your resume to the job you are applying for is very effective. For example, I come
    from grocery retail management. If I was looking for a retail job I would go into detail about the tasks I
    performed, my responsibilities, and customer service skills. If I was looking for an IT job I could go into detail
    about how I helped launch tech resets and train new stores on using new systems while including more detail about my
    education and certifications. The last point of listing accomplishments over responsibilities also stuck out to me.
    Saying “I helped to successfully open or re-open a dozen locations” sounds a lot better than saying one of your
    responsibilities was helping at other stores.
