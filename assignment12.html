        <h1>Assignment 12</h1>

        <p>
            This was an interesting assignment because while I was familiar with HTML going into this course, I had not
            considered accessibility the previous times I had used it. I was aware of some basic features like making
            sure the contrast is friendly to color-blind users and using alt-text on images. Setting a language, making
            sure elements of the document were properly defined, and learning about transcripts were all new to me. It
            was surprising to see how much goes into making a website perfectly accessible but it is clearly important
            as an issue of fairness and equality for all people using the internet.
