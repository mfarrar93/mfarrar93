    Activity 2:
    It was interesting to learn about different feauters of various web browsers.
    I had not heard of Brave before and was suprised I hadn't since it seems to offer many useful features other browsers do not have such as built in ad-blocking, tracker blocking, and cookie blocking. 
    I was also surprised to learn it had Tor browsing integrated into it as usually that is found in an extension or a purpose-built fork of an existing browser.
    I used to use Chrome almost exclusively but it's tendancy to use large amounts of memory steered me away a few years ago.
    When I opened chrome again I was reminded of a few features I had missed such as Google account integration.  
    Microsoft Edge performed surprisingly well. I had heard it switched to using Chromium, the technology that powers the Chrome browser, a few years ago. 
    I had not tried it in a long time. I was pleasantly surprised to find out it allows extensions Microsoft and is compatible with Chrome extensions due to their similar underlying technology. 
    I also know it has a compatibility mode for web pages that only work with Internet Explorer, which are unfortunately still fairly common. 
    Firefox is my default browser so it was nothing new but I really enjoy the wide variety of extensions and customization options availible.  
    Opera was interesting. I had not used tha in a long time and was happy to find a large number of new features.
    It has a number of very useful features built-in, including VPN, ad-blocking, and script-blocking. It seems like it would be perfect for using free streaming sites that are usually ad-riddled messes.
