    Assignment 2:
    This lesson was an introduction to web browsers.
    It included information on how web browsers work, how to use them, the features of various browsers, and how to add extensions and customize your browsing experience.

    Activity 1: 
    This activity gave a great refresher on the best practices one should use when using the internet. I went over a variety of tips to have a better experience using the internet. 
    I thought the video explaining app permissions was expecially relevant as it is something many people ignore or do not think about. 
    Knowing what information is being collected about you and how to prevent it is important for privacy. The explaination of spam and phishing is something all internet users should know. 
    While most people are familiar with spam emails they are less familiar with phishing and how to avoid it. I think even more important was the information about trackers. 
    I think we have all recieved unnervingly well-targeted ads online and have wondered why. I think it is vital to understand that when one is using a free online service, they are the product being sold. Your information is valuable and difficult to protect but these tips along with the explaination of private browsing can help people to safeguard their private information.

    Activity 2:
    This activity had me use multiple internet browsers and compare the differences between them. It was interesting to learn about different feauters of various web browsers.
    I had not heard of Brave before and was suprised I hadn't since it seems to offer many useful features other browsers do not have such as built in ad-blocking, tracker blocking, and cookie blocking. 
    I was also surprised to learn it had Tor browsing integrated into it as usually that is found in an extension or a purpose-built fork of an existing browser.
    I used to use Chrome almost exclusively but it's tendancy to use large amounts of memory steered me away a few years ago.
    When I opened chrome again I was reminded of a few features I had missed such as Google account integration.  
    Microsoft Edge performed surprisingly well. I had heard it switched to using Chromium, the technology that powers the Chrome browser, a few years ago. 
    I had not tried it in a long time. I was pleasantly surprised to find out it allows extensions Microsoft and is compatible with Chrome extensions due to their similar underlying technology. 
    I also know it has a compatibility mode for web pages that only work with Internet Explorer, which are unfortunately still fairly common. 
    Firefox is my default browser so it was nothing new but I really enjoy the wide variety of extensions and customization options availible.  
    Opera was interesting. I had not used tha in a long time and was happy to find a large number of new features.
    It has a number of very useful features built-in, including VPN, ad-blocking, and script-blocking. It seems like it would be perfect for using free streaming sites that are usually ad-riddled messes.

    Activity 6:
    This activity fcused on learning about browser extensions. I have always found browser extensions very useful and install an ad-blocker first thing before using the internet. 
    I found the tips there to be useful, especially disabling/removing unused extensions. I had a few I do not use frequently and I'm sure turning them off will help with resource usage. 
    The ones I do continue to use include an ad-blocker, ad-skipper for youtube, a VPN, a video casting extension, and a few extensions that apply a dark color scheme to websites I use frequently.
    Overall I think extensions are an important feature for most browsers. I immediately install an ad-blocker when helping anyone set up a PC. 
    The previous activity did teach me that some of the features I find through extensions are built in to some browsers out-of-the-box. 
    In the future I may just reccommend Opera to anyone asking what browser they should use as it has ad-blocking built in. 
    I will stick with Firefox due to the huge catalogue of extensions availible but for basic internet use I think Opera or Brave may be the quickest, easiest option for safe browsing. 
    I also installed a grammar-checking extension at the suggestion of the activity. I had not thouht to do so before but I am sure it will be very useful.
