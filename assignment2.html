    Activity 2:
    This activity had me use multiple internet browsers and compare the differences between them. It was interesting to learn about different feauters of various web browsers.
    I had not heard of Brave before and was suprised I hadn't since it seems to offer many useful features other browsers do not have such as built in ad-blocking, tracker blocking, and cookie blocking. 
    I was also surprised to learn it had Tor browsing integrated into it as usually that is found in an extension or a purpose-built fork of an existing browser.
    I used to use Chrome almost exclusively but it's tendancy to use large amounts of memory steered me away a few years ago.
    When I opened chrome again I was reminded of a few features I had missed such as Google account integration.  
    Microsoft Edge performed surprisingly well. I had heard it switched to using Chromium, the technology that powers the Chrome browser, a few years ago. 
    I had not tried it in a long time. I was pleasantly surprised to find out it allows extensions Microsoft and is compatible with Chrome extensions due to their similar underlying technology. 
    I also know it has a compatibility mode for web pages that only work with Internet Explorer, which are unfortunately still fairly common. 
    Firefox is my default browser so it was nothing new but I really enjoy the wide variety of extensions and customization options availible.  
    Opera was interesting. I had not used tha in a long time and was happy to find a large number of new features.
    It has a number of very useful features built-in, including VPN, ad-blocking, and script-blocking. It seems like it would be perfect for using free streaming sites that are usually ad-riddled messes.

    Activity 6:
    This activity fcused on learning about browser extensions. I have always found browser extensions very useful and install ad-block first thing before using the internet. 
    I found the tips there to be useful, especially disabling/removing unused extensions. I had a few I do not use frequently and I'm sure turning them off will help with resource usage. 
    The ones I do continue to use include an ad-blocker, ad-skipper for youtube, a VPN, a video casting extension, and a few extensions that apply a dark color scheme to websites I use frequently.
    Overall I think extensions are an important feature for most browsers. I immediately install an ad-blocker when helping anyone set up a PC. 
    The previous activity didteach me that some of the features I find through extensions are built in to some browsers out-of-the-box. 
    In the future I may just reccommend Opera to anyone asking what browser they should use as it has ad-blocking built in. 
    I will stick with Firefox due to the huge catalogue of extensions availible but for basic internet use I think Opera or Brave may be the quickest, easiest option for safe browsing.
