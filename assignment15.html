  <h1>Assignment 15</h1>


  <p>
    I was happy to have this assignment because I always find accomplishing a number of tasks to be easier if I write
    everything down and take it a step at a time. The Gantt chart offered a much cleaner and more readable variation of
    something I have been doing for a long time. It was also interesting to learn how to do something new in Excel. I
    learned how powerful a tool it can be in my Office class last semester and it is nice to have even more uses for it.
    This assignment helped me to get over that initial procrastination, decide on a project, and map out my timeline. I
    think this will result in a better final presentation and a less stressful final week of classes.
