    Activity 1
    The videos and reading in this activity gave a great overview of search engines. It went into both how they work and
    how to use them. I think understanding both of these is very important to be able to use search engines effectively.
    The reading explained how search engines work and I think the most important point to take away from it is how a
    search engine processes your search term. It does not try to find an answer to a question being asked like a person
    being asked a question; it is looking for the words you searched and showing you what it thinks the most relevant
    results for that search are. This is based on the most popular results people find for the term you searched, the
    popularity of the webpage, and numerous other metrics. The video lessons do a great job of teaching you how to use a
    search engine effectively. I think understanding how search engines work provides good context for why the lessons
    it presents are effective. It goes through the various search tabs besides web results such as images, video, and
    news. I thought example of searching for “sugar cookie” was very good. By searching the term without quotes, you can
    easily find results for cookies with sugar in the recipe. By adding quotes around the words, the search engine only
    looks for the two words in that order as opposed to individually.

    Activity 2
    I had not used Ask.com or Yahoo in a long time. I found the results for both to be a bit lacking. Ask lacked the
    info boxes that the other 3 search engines have for things like weather and sports scores. Yahoo had a decent
    presentation but I think it suffers from not having access to the level of personalization data that Bing and
    especially Google have to curate results for me. I will use Bing on my laptop for everyday searches. This is not out
    of a preference but because of the rewards program they have for just searching that ends up paying for a few months
    of Xbox Live for me every year. If I cant find something I always will go to Google as I find it has the most
    updated and accurate results. I also find I have the most success with google when searching for something that is
    very specific or obscure. As I expected Google had the best market share of all the search engines.

    Activity 4
    SEO is extremely important for websites as it allows users to find them. There are good basic ideas that seem like
    they haven’t changed since I read up on them over a decade ago. A web crawler goes through links to index data so
    having your site linked to from other places makes it easier to find. It also takes time for it to update. There
    were also other good tips like making a local business profile, considering mobile and desktop user-friendliness,
    having basic site security, and even getting professional help to improve your SEO.
