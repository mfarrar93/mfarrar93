    <p>Learning Summary:<br>
        This was the most time-consuming of all of the activities we have completed but I think I came away from it with a good understanding of the basics of SQL and much more confidence in using it in the future. I found SQL to be very human-readable and understandable after completing the activities. I had initially assumed there would be large amounts of syntax and that it would be very unforgiving but by about halfway through the activities I was able to write a few of the queries myself without having to look them up or base it on the previous question. I'm glad this used the W3C site as I think it is a great resource.
