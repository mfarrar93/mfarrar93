  <h1>Assignment 4</h1>

  <p>
    Activity 1
    This first activity went over the basics of email usage, how it works, and the features available in email clients.
    It did a good job getting to all the basics such as creating an account and sending a message. It went into further
    detail by going over the other productivity features available in an email client such as a calendar and address
    book. These features are very useful in the business world and are a main part of desktop email clients which are
    also more common in a work environment. I thought it was good that this activity went through basic email safety
    tips. Phishing is a major problem and the reading gave ways to identify suspicious emails such as checking the
    "from" address to make sure the source of the message is not being misrepresented.

    Activity 3
    I found this activity to be important because I used a desktop email client very regularly in my previous career.
    There are differences to understand from web to desktop mail and features to learn to use it effectively. I also
    think that the process of setting up a personal email in a desktop client helps one to understand how email works
    such as having incoming and outgoing servers. I was also happy to see you can just sign in now instead of putting in
    servers manually.

    Activity 4
    I thought this activity was useful because it brought up ways spoofing is used that I had not considered. It talks
    about phishing and how that is used to make an email appear from a legitimate source in an attempt to get the
    recipient to give up personal information or scam them in some other way. I had not considered the possibility of a
    malicious program faking a source email address to make it harder to find where the infection is coming from. By
    making it appear as if the malicious software is being sent from a variety of addresses it is harder to find out the
    actual source of the issue.
