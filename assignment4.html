   Activity 1 
This first acivity went over the basics of email usage, how it works, and the features availible in email clients. It did a good job getting to all the basics such as creating an account and sending a message. It went into further details by going over the other productivity features availible in an email client such as a calendar and address book. These features are very useful in the business world and are a main part of desktop email clients which are also more common in a work environment. I thought it was good that this activity wnet through basic email safety tips. Phishing is a major problem and the reading gave ways to identify suspicious emails such as checking the "from" address to make sure the source of the message is not being misrepresented.

   Activity 3 
I found this activity to be important because I used a desktop email client very regularly in my previous career. There are differences to understand from web mail and features to learn in order to use it effectively. I also think that the process of setting up a personal email in a desktop client helps one to understand how email works such as having incoming and outgoing servers. I was also happy to see you can just sign in now instead of putting in servers manually.

    Activity 4 
I thought this activity was useful because it brought up ways spoofing is used that I had not considered. It talks about phishing and how that is used to make an email appear from a legitimate source in an attempt to get the ecipient to give up personal information or scam them in some other way. I had not considered the possibility of a malicious program faking a source email address in order to make it harder to find where the infection is coming from. By making it appear as if the malicious software is being sent from a variety of addresses it is harder to find out the actual source of the issue.
