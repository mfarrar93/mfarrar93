    It was interesting learning how to add media to a webpage. It took a bit of trial and error, but eventually I was
    able to properly crop my images and display them inline with a &lt;div&gt; tag. I also learned the escape characters
    for "&lt;" and "&gt;" to use them as text rather than syntax in a document. I also enjoyed learning about vector
    graphics. I knew that they used math to define an image rather than a bitmap but seeing the file displayed to me as
    text in the VSC editor really drove home how vecotr graphics are possible and how they work. It was also suprising
    to see how easy it was to add audio and video to a page.
