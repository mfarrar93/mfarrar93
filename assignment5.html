    Activity 1 (Social Media)<br>
    This activity went over a variety of social networking services. It was a bit outdated as it included Google Plus
    which has been discontinued. That would date the information to around 2018. What surprised me is how common the
    other examples are which showed the social media sites available have been not changed significantly in the last few
    years. The other sites mentioned like Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, and Linkedin continue to be some of the most
    popular options. I learned of a few services I had not heard of like Idibo, Line, and Hike which are call and
    messaging apps.

    Activity 1 (Communications)<br>
    This activity did a nice job going over the variety of services that allow people to interact over the internet. It
    went over some older services that I have not heard about in a long time such as newsgroups and IRC. It made me
    think about what services have taken the place of these. I would argue reddit is the spiritual successor of
    newsgroups as there are many dedicated subreddits for talking about specific subjects. IRC has been replaced by a
    variety of services from text messaging to Discord. It also went over familiar services like email, mailing lists,
    VoIP, and instant messaging. It then talked about how these services are facilitated using the internet and can
    involve direct connections between two users or many users connecting to each other via a central control unit.

    Activity 3 (Communications)<br>
    This was interesting as I have used remote desktop services in the past but was not familiar with newer services. I
    was particularly interested in Chrome Remote Desktop as the idea of managing things through my Google account seemed
    like it would be a lot better than setting up a VNC. I was still pleasantly surprised at how quickly and easily I
    could set up access to my laptop. I then saw it could be done on mobile devices and was able to access it just as
    easily on my phone. It is extremely responsive to the point that I may even test out using my laptop to play games
    from my PC. Iâ€™d expect it to be slower if the devices were not on the same local network but it is still miles
    better than what I remember of using VNC. It is great that it only requires a program to be installed on the
    computer being accessed and a just a web browser to access it.
