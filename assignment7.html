   Activity 1<br>
   This first activity went over a lot of information on the protocols and concepts that make up the internet. It began by going through the OSI model of the internet which is comprised of 7 layers. From top to bottom these are the application, presentation, session, transport, network, data link, and physical layers. This model allows one to understand the basic principles of how the internet works and what functions are performed by each layer. There is also the TCP/IP mode comprised of four layers – application, transport, internet, and host to network. The activity continues by going over some of the major protocols used in internet communication. TCP is used with IP in order to provide for reliability in communications. It performs an acknowledgment between computers to establish a connection. FTP allows for file transfer and TFTP is a simpler version without authentication or reliability features. HTTP defines communication between a user and a web server and is the main protocol for using internet sites.

   Activity 2<br>
 The second activity gave an overview on basic network troubleshooting and maintenance. It went over a number of things a person can do in order to diagnose and repair their internet connection. This ranged from basic things such and making sure Wi-Fi is enabled to an overview of the internet troubleshooting tool. Some basic tips include power cycling your router and devices and ensuring the physical Wi-Fi switch on your laptop is turned on. This tool will run basic tests on your network to discover what issues you are having and where they are occurring within the network. The next part of this activity involved running the ipconfig utility. Running the utility from the command line in windows will display information about the configuration of your network including IP addresses, connections being used, and general setup information. By releasing and renewing your IP address with ipconfig you are resetting the information and requesting a new IP address from your ISP. Running ipconfig again after this process will show you the information about the new connection and verify you received a new address.

    Activity 3 <br>
  The third activity went over more basic troubleshooting and diagnostics for internet connection problems. This begins with very basic ideas like ensuring the lights on your network adapter are on and it is working and making sure physical connections are not broken. It goes on to take you through multiple diagnostic tools. The first is IP config which was covered in the previous activity. It will display information about your connection and arguments to the command will allow you to make changes like releasing and renewing your IP address. Ping was the next tool covered. It is a basic utility that allows you to verify a connection with local and remote addresses by sending a simple message back and forth between them. Tracert will go a step further and list all the ‘hops’ your connection took from host to host. It will not only identify the start and end of the connection but also the path it took along the way. Nslookup allows you to view DNS information. You can use the command on a web address to see the actual IP address of the server you are connecting to as opposed to the domain name. It can check both IPv4 and IPv6. The last part of the activity involves using a custom DNS server and shows you can use multiple options for DNS and they will all provide the same service.
