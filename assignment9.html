  <h1>Assignment 9</h1>

  <p>
    This activity went fairly quickly for me as I had already formatted my assignments the way it requested. I am
    already familiar with HTML from making GeoCities websites over a decade ago. The basic tags are the same, but I am
    very interested in learning more about HTML 5 and the newer features of both HTML and CSS that have been introduced
    since I last used them. I was happy to learn about the online GitHub editing tool. I did not know that I could
    directly manipulate the files in my repository in a more fully-featured editor than the one on the main GitHub
    site. This editor is more familiar to me as it highlights syntax which I find useful.
